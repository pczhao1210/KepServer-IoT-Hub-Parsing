## Kepware IoT Hub Agent parsing tool

Prequisitions: run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before use.

This tool aimed to parsing the array format data send from KepServer MQTT Agent to IOT Hub, using build-in Event Hub endpoint to retrive the payload then processing the whole array to isoloated messages. Makes it easier to do future processing.

Also, please feel free to use the sample data and sample processor to tune your code.
